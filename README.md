## Lyricify - An app for live lyrics

An app to show you time synced lyrics for your favourite songs!


## What it does:

You can view real time lyrics for (almost) any song playing via Spotify.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
1. Go to the releases section.
2. Download and install the latest APK.
3. Open Spotify, go to settings and make sure that device broadcast status is turned on. Lyricify will not work without it.
4. Now open Lyricify, turn on the lyrics switch and you'll see media controls pop up. It is not necessary to enter the API key.
5. Make sure that the song progress bar is at 0s (at the very beginning) for time synced lyrics to work.
6. Hit play(in Lyricify, not Spotify) and enjoy singing along to your song!

## Features:
- Lyrics are shown in real time.
- App background is set as album art image of the currently playing song.
- Status bar and navigation bar colour changes to dominant colour of the album art.
